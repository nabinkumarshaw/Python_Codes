# Write a python programming to translate a message into secrete code language. Use the rules below to translate normal English into secrete code language

#coding

#1)if the word contains at least 3 characters,remove the first letter and append it at the end
#2)now append 3 random character,at the first and last and append
#3)else
#simply reverse the string

#decoding
#1)if the word contains less than 3 character just reverse it
#2)else
#remove 3 random character from start and end .Now remove the last letter and append itv to the begining

#your program should ask the user weather you want to code or decode
