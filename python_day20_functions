#First example
def arithmeticmean(a,b):
  mean=(a+b)/2
  print(mean)

arithmeticmean(2,6)

#second example
def harmonicmean(x,y):
  pass
  #this pass means later i will write the code of this function

#third example
def average(num1,num2,num3):
  sum=num1+num2+num3
  avg=sum/3
  print(avg)

average(10,20,30)
